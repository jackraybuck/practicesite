<h2>Background</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">I spent 2014-2018 attending the University of Arkansas, where I received a Bachelor's Degree in Business Marketing. My passion for design came from my love of music; during my Undergrad I began to teach myself the princples of the Adobe programs in order to create album and single art, flyers, and other collateral for musicians in my hometown.</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">Over the last few years, I've worked internship positions at Universal Music Group, Pitch Magazine, and KC Magazine. I currently work as a UI/UX Design Intern at GigSmart, a tech startup based out of Denver, Colorado.</p>

<h2>Learning HTML</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">Right now, I'm using this website as an opportunity to learn HTML, CSS, and responsive Web Design. My goal is to be able to create my own website from scratch. In the meantime, you can view my current portfolio <a href="https://jackraybuck.cargo.site/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
